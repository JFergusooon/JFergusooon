- 👋 Hi, I’m @JFergusooon

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with a strong focus on full-stack development—particularly in backend systems, distributed architectures, databases, and scalable web applications. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and building systems that are not only robust but also user-focused.

My technical toolkit includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), Java, C#, React, Python, REST APIs, Java Springboot, Swift, Containerization, and a range of other modern technologies. I enjoy tackling complex problems and take a thoughtful approach to both system design and implementation.

Beyond the code, I thrive in collaborative environments. I communicate effectively across cross-functional teams, support knowledge-sharing, and believe the best solutions often come from strong partnerships. Whether I'm contributing to a large-scale deployment or mentoring a teammate, I bring a positive, team-first mindset.

Currently based in Salt Lake City, Utah, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and am always seeking new challenges where I can learn, grow, and add real value.
